# WEBS-auth
Authentification on websites

Here is the project for showing what we can do with JWT and Passport
In this repo, there are three folders:
./build (for the tutorial - Sphinx was used to do that (in French))  
./source (the sources for the tuto files - if you want to custom it)  
./node (this folder contains all the files needed to follow the project and to test the project)  
Just add the folder node to your server (or in local) and follow the tutorial.  

Enjoy!
